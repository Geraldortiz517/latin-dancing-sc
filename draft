        Salsa By The Sea is a free, weekly outdoor salsa dance event held on 
        the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf. The event runs all year long
         (except when it rains) and the start time depends on the season
          (later in the summer, earlier in the winter). Some weekends are 
          “Bachata by the Sea”, with more bachata music played than salsa. 
          Occasionally there will be lessons as well, but mostly the event is
           for social dancing.
